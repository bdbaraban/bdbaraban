### I'm honored you're visiting my GitHub! :octocat:

Allow me to show you around:

👇 I've pinned the four repositories that most closely reflect my development skills and focus today. Two are personal projects, the other two were built with peers when I was studying at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com).

🧐 You might notice a dearth of green squares since September 2019. This is because that is the time I joined Einstein Studios as Lead Software Engineer. Naturally, I cannot share the private repositories I've been working in, but to share an overview of what I've been up to:

- 🐨 Currently I am building Koala, a 3D, collaborative virtual classroom software. For this project, I learned Unity, but i additionally own the supporting web and Electron applications built using React and Electron.
  - [teachwithkoala.com](https://teachwithkoala.com)
  - Unity, C++, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Electron, MySQL, AWS, Vercel, Photon Engine
  
- 🇪🇸 My first project with Einstein Studios involved building web platforms for the company's original product, a virtual reality application for Spanish and reading tutoring. These were full-stack React and MySQL applications that managed user onboarding, recurring weekly scheduling, and subscription processing.
  - [einsteinstudios.io](https://einsteinstudios.io)
  - TypeScript, React, GatsbyJS, MySQL, Stripe, AWS, Vercel
