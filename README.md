### I'm honored you're visiting my GitHub! :octocat:

Allow me to show you around:

👇 I've pinned the four repositories that most closely reflect my development skills and focus today. Two are personal projects, the other two were built with peers while studying at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com).

🧐 You might notice a dearth of green squares since September 2019. This the time I joined [Einstein Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/einstein-studios/) as Lead Software Engineer. Naturally, I cannot share the private repositories I've been working in, but to give an overview of what I've been up to:

- 🐨 Currently, I am working together with Einstein Studios' CTO to build Koala, a 3D, collaborative virtual classroom software supported on Mac, Windows and web. For this project, I learned Unity, but I additionally own the accompanying web lobby and launcher applications built using Next.js and Electron.
  - [teachwithkoala.com](https://teachwithkoala.com)
  - Unity, C++, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Electron, MySQL, AWS, Vercel, Photon Engine
  
- 🇪🇸 My first project with Einstein Studios involved designing and shipping web platforms for the company's original product, a virtual reality Spanish and reading tutoring application. These were full-stack React, Node & MySQL applications that managed user onboarding, tutor-student scheduling, and payments processing.
